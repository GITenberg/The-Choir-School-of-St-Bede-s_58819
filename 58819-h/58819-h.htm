<small>THE NEW SOLO-BOY.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was a lovely morning, about eleven o&#8217;clock,
and the boys of the cathedral choir of St.
Bede&#8217;s were playing in the cloister of the
grand old church. There was a square plot of
grass in the centre, where the boys used to
amuse themselves during the intervals of school-work;
when it was wet they would walk round
the covered cloister.</p>

<p>One boy, of about eleven years, was standing
by himself, looking shyly on without taking any
part in the games of the others. He was leaning
against a stone pillar, when one of the bigger
boys came up to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the new probationer solo-boy, aren&#8217;t
you?&#8221; he demanded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Alfred Davidson, for that was
his name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From Darlton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an engineer on a ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On board of a man-of-war?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; on one of the big ships that go to
Australia,&#8221; replied Alfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you think no small cheese of yourself
now you&#8217;ve got a place in the choir, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221; said the other with a sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very pleased to get into this choir, as I
am fond of music, and I hope I shall be an
organist some day,&#8221; replied Alfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Organist!&#8221; laughed the other. &#8220;You&#8217;ll never
be fit for anything except to blow the organ. I
suppose you would consider that assistant-organist?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly! some people aren&#8217;t good enough
even for that,&#8221; replied Alfred, moving behind
the stone pillar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed!&#8221; said King, &#8220;aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>He aimed a backhanded slap at Alfred as he
spoke, but the latter bobbed his head, and King
barked his knuckles.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s your little game, is it?&#8221; he exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and seizing Alfred he shook him and threw him
on to the grass, nearly causing another boy, who
was stepping backwards, to roll over him. Alfred
got up at once and brushed his clothes, and while
he was doing so another boy came up and spoke
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am, now,&#8221; replied Alfred, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I see,&#8221; said Walter Parker, laughing; &#8220;but
you were down a moment ago, weren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has Herbert King been bullying you because
you&#8217;ve got the place he wanted his brother to
have?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know the name of the boy who
pushed me down,&#8221; replied Alfred, &#8220;but he did
not have it all his own way. He went to hit
me, and as I ducked my head he knocked his
knuckles against the pillar instead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad of it,&#8221; said Walter. &#8220;It serves
him right; he is far too fond of bullying, especially
new boys. If I catch him at it I will
punch his head again, as I did last week. You
tell me if he hits you, and I will square accounts
with him. What is your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alfred Davidson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Davidson, I hope we shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
friends. My name is Walter Parker, and I live
in Cross Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; said Alfred. &#8220;I am staying with
Mrs. Dawson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I live next door, so we can go home together.&#8221;</p>

<p>These few words made Alfred feel quite happy,
and at the invitation of his new friend he joined
in the game of prisoner&#8217;s base. Walter Parker
was thirteen years of age, a stout, well-built boy,
although not very tall.</p>

<p>Alfred Davidson, although so young, had a
voice of wonderful power and sweetness, and
having been taught music by his mother for
some time, he had at eight entered the choir of
the parish church of Darlton, where he had continued
his training for some three years. He
had just succeeded in obtaining not only a place
in the choir by competition, to the exclusion of
Herbert King&#8217;s younger brother, but even the
appointment of a probationer soloist, which was
very unusual for so young a boy.</p>

<p>The deputy choir-master, who was also the
schoolmaster, called the boys in to work. The
room was under the cathedral library, and led
out of the cloister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alfred Davidson!&#8221; called Mr. Harmer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>&#8220;Davidson,&#8221; said Walter Parker to him, &#8220;&#8216;uncle&#8217;
is calling you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he your uncle?&#8221; inquired Alfred, as he
moved out of his seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Walter; &#8220;but we always call
him uncle behind his back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here,&#8221; said Mr. Harmer; &#8220;I want to
examine you, to see in which division I can
place you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alfred answered the questions put to him
sufficiently well to be placed in the first division.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope, Davidson, you will work well, so that
I may be able to keep you in this division. If
not, of course I shall put you down into the
second. You can go back to your seat again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter Parker assisted Mr. Harmer by taking
the youngest and the most backward boys.
Herbert King was his equal as far as knowledge
went, but the master had chosen Walter in
preference to King, as he was more patient
and careful in the work. These two boys were
the principal soloists, but as King&#8217;s voice was
beginning to show signs of breaking, it was
necessary to have another boy in training, ready
to take his place later on. King had hoped that
his brother would obtain a place in the choir,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
but the organist, Dr. Phillips, and Mr. Young,
the precentor (one of the clergy who assist in
directing the musical services), had both chosen
Alfred to fill the vacancy. This was one reason
why King felt anything but friendly towards the
newcomer.</p>

<p>As the boys were going home, one of them,
Stephen Gray, filled a paper bag with water at
the school tap, unseen by Alfred, who was slowly
sauntering along.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with that?&#8221; inquired
Walter Parker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait and see,&#8221; replied Steve, running on and
calling out to Alfred. &#8220;Davidson!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; replied Alfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you catch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then catch this,&#8221; said Steve, throwing the
bag as he spoke.</p>

<p>Alfred, being quite unused to the tricks of
schoolboys&mdash;choir-boys are not a bit different
from other boys&mdash;attempted to catch the bag,
and the moment it reached his hands the water
spurted all over his face and clothes. He was
too much surprised to say anything, and Steve,
who was a good-natured boy, after laughing at
the success of his joke, wiped him with his handkerchief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and accompanied him and Walter, as
he lived near them.</p>

<p>When Alfred had finished his tea he wrote
home a long letter to his mother and sister,
trying to make them feel quite happy about
him. He hoped that in a few days he should
like all the boys as much as he liked Walter and
Stephen. Mrs. Dawson was very kind to him,
and he went to bed feeling hopeful and happy.</p>

<p>The next morning, as he was walking up to
the cathedral, the Rev. Mr. Young, the precentor,
met him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the new boy, are you not?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; replied Alfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you getting on, my boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir, thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall inquire from time to time of Mr.
Harmer to see how you progress in your work,
and if you do well in your Latin, later on I will
teach you Greek, if you think you would care to
learn it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir; I should very much like
to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your name is Davidson, is it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, Alfred Davidson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Davidson, stick to your work and be a
good boy. My old college friend is vicar of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Darlton, and knows your mother well, so I
shall feel an extra interest in you, and he can
tell your mother, when I write to him, how
you get on with your work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now run on and join your fellow-choristers.
As you are early, you will have a quarter of
an hour for play before work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alfred raised his cap and ran away to catch
his new friends, Walter and Stephen. They
met Herbert King and three other boys, who
joined them, and walked up to a large open
space near the cathedral, where they played
cricket and football. It was a very pretty place.
There were several large trees, and close by ran
the river, on which some of the boys used to
row, as the father of one of the choristers owned
boats, and let them out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you play football, Davidson?&#8221; asked
King.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;that is, not much,&#8221; replied Alfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will be on our side,&#8221; exclaimed Walter.
&#8220;He will soon learn.&#8221;</p>

<p>The game began. It was near the end of
March, so they had not yet commenced cricket,
as the weather had been too wet and cold.
Alfred was put among the forwards, and being a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
very quick runner, succeeded in shooting a goal
for his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was off-side,&#8221; exclaimed King angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;No it wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Walter.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_013.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;You always say &#8216;off-side&#8217; when we score a
goal,&#8221; said Stephen Gray; &#8220;but if you kick one
it is always quite fair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, have your own way,&#8221; replied
King, moving off to kick the ball.</p>

<p>The game then became very exciting. King
seemed on the point of scoring a goal for his side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
when Alfred cleverly got the ball away, and carried
it right down the field into the enemy&#8217;s quarters.
King did not say anything, but there was
an angry look on his face. Shortly afterwards
Alfred was violently pushed from the back and
sent off the grass on to the gravel path, where he
lay for a few moments, too much shaken to move.</p>

<p>&#8220;Foul!&#8221; shouted Stephen. &#8220;You know, King,
that isn&#8217;t fair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; exclaimed King in a
passion. &#8220;Do you dare to say I cheat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Steve fearlessly. &#8220;You pushed
Davidson down on purpose; I saw you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then take that,&#8221; exclaimed King, aiming at
Steve a blow, which he dodged, and in return
hit out.</p>

<p>Alfred had got up, but his hands and face were
bleeding from the scratches. The other boys
had gone on with the game and had not noticed
the disturbance. Steve was goal-keeper, while
Walter was playing centre forward and was
making a dash for the goal. Alfred wiped his
face and hands with his handkerchief, and although
he was hurt, was going forward to rejoin
the game, when he saw Steve hit King back.
King was a bigger boy than Steve, but the latter
was not afraid of him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>&#8220;You dare to hit me!&#8221; said King. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give
you one for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you won&#8217;t,&#8221; exclaimed Walter, running
up; &#8220;it&#8217;s football we&#8217;re playing, not boxing.
What&#8217;s all this row about?&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephen had not time to answer, as the school
bell rang, and the boys had to run in. Alfred
dipped his handkerchief in some water at the
school tap and wiped his face and hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; said Mr. Harmer, directly after calling
over the names, &#8220;I have something to say to you.
First, I hear that some of you are in the habit
of playing near the old pit-mouth; in fact I have
been told that you go down it with a rope, and
sometimes play in it. I must forbid your doing
so, as it is very dangerous. You know it was a
coal-mine, but has been closed for several years,
and in all probability there is a great quantity
of water at the bottom after the rain. The
ground also might at any time fall in, as it has
done before. The second thing is, that you must
not row on the river near the weir, as it is dangerous
even for a good rower. You may go up
the river above the bridge as far as you like, as
the water is not very deep and the current is
not strong. Now get your books.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alfred was busily engaged in doing his sums,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and not noticing anything or anybody else, when
Harry Cox asked him to help him, as he was
very bad at figures. Alfred showed him how to
do the practice sums and some decimals, and then
finished his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cox,&#8221; said the master, &#8220;bring up your work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cox took up his book and showed it to Mr.
Harmer.</p>

<p>&#8220;These are much better, Cox, than usual,&#8221; said
Mr. Harmer. &#8220;Did you do them all alone, or did
anyone help you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did them, sir, all alone,&#8221; replied Harry
promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I saw you talking to Davidson
just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, but it was not about the sums.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed!&#8221; replied the master, as if he did
not altogether believe what Cox said. &#8220;You can
go back to your seat.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the boys met again, before afternoon
school, Cox came up to Alfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Davidson,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if Mr.
Harmer asks you about my sums at any time,
mind you just keep your mouth shut.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And supposing I shouldn&#8217;t?&#8221; inquired Alfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I shall punch your head after school,&#8221;
replied Cox.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>&#8220;Then punch away!&#8221; exclaimed Alfred, darting
round a lamp-post.</p>

<p>Cox ran after him to carry out Alfred&#8217;s suggestion,
when the latter dodged round a man
walking along the street, and Cox, not being
quite quick enough, charged the stranger before
he could stop himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take that!&#8221; exclaimed the irritated man,
giving Cox a hearty box on the ears, which made
them sing for some minutes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Alfred had run on and reached the
school before Cox had any chance of catching
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cox, come here!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Harmer, when
the school was reassembled.</p>

<p>Cox promptly went up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you to do those two sums again that
you did this morning,&#8221; said the master. &#8220;Sit
down there where I can see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cox sat down, knowing very well that he could
not do the sums alone. Alfred heard this, and
felt almost as uncomfortable as Cox himself.
While he was writing out some parsing in
English, a small piece of paper was put into his
hand. He opened it.</p>

<p><i>Just do those sums again for me or I shall
split on you.&mdash;H. C.</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>&#8220;What are you doing, Davidson?&#8221; demanded
the master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone put a piece of paper in my hand,
sir,&#8221; replied Alfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alfred took it up to his master.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wrote this, Cox?&#8221; said Mr. Harmer.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; replied Harry Cox quickly, and
then stammered out: &#8220;I mean yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You told me a lie then when you said you
had not been assisted?&#8221;</p>

<p>Harry Cox turned very red and said nothing.
It was useless for him to deny it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am perfectly well aware that you had been
assisted. For telling me an untruth I shall give
you six sums extra to do; and if I find you out
in another lie, I shall cane you. Davidson, as
you are not a teacher here, I shall be obliged to
you if you will confine your attention to your
own work. If the boys require assistance, either
Walter Parker or myself will help them. As
you are a new boy, I will say nothing more this
time, but don&#8217;t do it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alfred looked somewhat foolish, but not so
much so as Cox, who was less grieved at his
fault than at being found out and punished.</p>

<p>Several of the boys had arranged to have an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
hour on the river later in the day, and as Alfred
was running off to join his new friends, Walter
Parker and Steve Gray, King met him.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_019.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Davidson, come here,&#8221; he cried out. &#8220;Where
are you off to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The boats,&#8221; replied Alfred, without stopping.</p>

<p>King soon overtook him, and giving him a slap
on the face, exclaimed:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>&#8220;Take that, you little sneak! Now you can
go and tell &#8216;uncle&#8217; that virtue has been rewarded.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alfred ran away again as quickly as he could,
and found Walter and Steve waiting for him in
a boat. They were going to row, while he was
to steer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes your face so red on one side?&#8221;
asked Steve.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was hit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who did it? Herbert King, I suppose?&#8221;
demanded Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said I was a sneak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When we meet him again we&#8217;ll give him one
back,&#8221; exclaimed Steve, who had not yet settled
his own quarrel with King.</p>

<p>They rowed up the river for about half an
hour, and then pulled the boat up to the side of
the bank and got out their fishing-rods. Although
it was still the month of March the
weather was quite warm. They fished in silence
for some time, when a second boat came up with
King and three other boys in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say, Parker,&#8221; exclaimed
King, &#8220;that you have let that little sneak come
with you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t a little sneak,&#8221; retorted Walter.
&#8220;What did you hit him for? He only spoke the
truth, as I should have done in his place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sneaking, of course,&#8221; replied King, splashing
the water so as to disturb their fishing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop that!&#8221; cried Steve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make me!&#8221; replied King, pulling away and
splashing more than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; said Walter, &#8220;I&#8217;ll make you pay
for that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When?&#8221; demanded King, rowing off.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow, if you&#8217;ll come to the green early,&#8221;
replied Walter, who was now thoroughly angry.</p>

<p>After they had gone, Walter and Steve fished
for some time, but caught nothing, so they put
their rods away and began to row gently back.
They heard a shout, and saw the other boat
coming after them as fast as the boys could pull
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Steve!&#8221; cried Walter; &#8220;don&#8217;t let them
catch us up; pull away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Walter,&#8221; replied Steve, &#8220;I&#8217;ll back
you up!&#8221;</p>

<p>The boat moved quickly through the water,
but, after a few minutes, the other began to gain
on them. They pulled as hard as they could,
when they heard a noise, and saw that one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
boys in the other boat had caught a crab and
had lost his oar. They were near the bridge,
where the water was deep, and the current, being
narrowed in width, ran more quickly. Steve
and Walter shot through the middle arch and
left off rowing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Walter,&#8221; cried out Steve, &#8220;they haven&#8217;t got a
rudder, and are drifting against the bridge!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out, King,&#8221; shouted Walter, &#8220;or you&#8217;ll
be dashed against the bridge!&#8221;</p>

<p>King turned his head round, and in a moment
saw the danger which threatened his boat; it
was rapidly drifting nearly broadside towards
the centre pier of the bridge. If it struck it,
there was every probability of its being capsized.
He began to pull vigorously with his one oar,
when it snapped, and, with a grating noise, the
boat struck the bridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit still all of you,&#8221; shouted King, &#8220;or you&#8217;ll
have the boat over!&#8221;</p>

<p>Standing up, he held tightly to the bridge,
while Walter and Steve turned their boat round
and pulled hard against the stream to their help.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stir!&#8221; cried King, as one of the boys
in fear tried to clutch hold of the pier. &#8220;If
you move we shall all be in the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter and Steve pulled through the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
arch, and, coming close to the boat, Alfred laid
hold of the stern of it while they rowed. In a
few minutes they had drawn the second boat up
the stream, clear of the bridge; then, again pulling
round, they fastened it behind theirs, shot the
bridge, and soon reached the landing-stage.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a near shave, King,&#8221; said Walter.</p>

<p>King knew it, although he did not answer. He
was pale, and directly they landed he ran off to
his home, hardly thanking them for their timely
assistance.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>THE FIRST OF APRIL.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was the first day of April, and a lovely
morning, as Alfred was strolling slowly to
school. In the distance he saw Cox and King
talking earnestly together, and as he came near
they took out some coppers and counted them.
Since the boat accident they had been less unfriendly,
and often walked to school with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Davidson,&#8221; said King, &#8220;I wish you would
just get us something from Mr. Cottenham&#8217;s;
there&#8217;s a good fellow. Here&#8217;s a piece of paper
with the names of the things written down, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
you need only give it to him. Here&#8217;s threepence
to pay for them. We will wait here for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alfred read the paper. On it was written:
<i>1d. of pidgon&#8217;s milk in a peny vile, and 1d. of
strongest strap-oil for the barer for his trouble</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wrote this, Cox, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; inquired
Alfred, smiling the smile of the innocent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; why do you ask? It&#8217;s written plain
enough, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked Cox.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s plain enough, and I can read it all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what do you want to know for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because the spelling is not right. <i>P-i-g-e-o-n</i>
spells <i>pigeon</i>, and a bottle is <i>vial</i> not <i>vile</i>, and
<i>bearer</i> is spelt with an <i>e</i> in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any more mistakes?&#8221; said Cox angrily. &#8220;It
was a bad pen I&#8217;d got, and I should like to know
how anyone can be expected to spell with a rotten
old nib.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cox&#8217;s weakness in spelling was a cause of
many impositions at school, as Mr. Harmer made
him write out ten times every word which was
not correctly spelt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, youngster,&#8221; said King, &#8220;will you take
this to Mr. Cottenham&#8217;s, or won&#8217;t you? If you
won&#8217;t, I can go myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go with pleasure,&#8221; said Alfred, pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to do anything for anyone at any time, especially
for those with whom he now hoped to make
friends.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_025.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the money,&#8221; said Cox, winking at
King. &#8220;Mind you tell Mr. Cottenham that the
strap-oil is for yourself&mdash;for your trouble in
getting the things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; replied Alfred, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t want
to be paid for doing a little thing like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Davidson!&#8221; said Cox; &#8220;you did us a
good turn the other day, and so I want to pay
you back for it, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, very much,&#8221; said Alfred amicably,
running off to the chemist&#8217;s shop, which was quite
near.</p>

<p>Mr. Cottenham was a very big man, with a very
big moustache and a very big voice; but withal
a very jolly man and very popular with everybody.
He was standing in his shop, whistling a
merry tune and talking to his gray parrot, when
Alfred came in. He knew Mr. Cottenham by
sight, as he was often in the cathedral, being
very fond of music. As he walked into the shop,
the parrot gave a whistle and a scream, and said:
&#8220;Shop! you&#8217;re wanted!&#8221;</p>

<p>Alfred looked at the parrot and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want a pill?&#8221; said the bird, and then
it whistled again, and sighed in a very natural
manner. &#8220;Come, Joe, hurry up!&#8221; continued the
parrot.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>&#8220;All right, Poll!&#8221; said Mr. Cottenham, &#8220;I will.
You are one of the choir-boys, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; replied Alfred, &#8220;Will you kindly
let me have these things? The strap-oil is for
myself, for the trouble of bringing the note.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see. What is to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The first of April, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I should imagine. I often get orders like
yours on this day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Cottenham enjoyed a joke as much as
anyone, and nothing pleased him more than to
turn a joke against those who tried to victimize
others. He gave Alfred some nice jujubes, saying
that that was the best form of strap-oil for taking.
Then he got a small bottle, and put something
into it which smelt like very strong onions, and
to this he added some liquid like water, also with
a very strong odour. Then all the liquid became
milky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phew!&#8221; whistled the bird, and added: &#8220;Cork
it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alfred could not help laughing at the droll
sayings of the parrot, which seemed so suitable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you whistle?&#8221; said Poll, giving a loud
shrill whistle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you are, my boy,&#8221; said Mr. Cottenham,
smiling, &#8220;give this to the boy who sent you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; replied Alfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; screamed out Poll.</p>

<p>Alfred stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the time?&#8221; said Poll; and then it
laughed just like a human being.</p>

<p>Mr. Cottenham went to the door and watched
the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the pigeon&#8217;s milk,&#8221; said Alfred, handing
Cox the bottle.</p>

<p>Cox tore the paper off and saw the milky
liquid, and eagerly pulled out the cork to smell
it. It was so strong, that he jerked the contents
over King&#8217;s coat.</p>

<p>&#8220;He laughs loudest who laughs last,&#8221; said Mr.
Cottenham, smiling. &#8220;That joke has cost you
threepence, at all events.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys ran off quickly, and turned round the
corner of the street before they stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a little fool you are,&#8221; said King, &#8220;to
bring that stinking stuff! I must wash my coat
or it will smell in the cathedral.&#8221;</p>

<p>King rubbed his jacket with his moistened
handkerchief, but he could not get rid of the smell.</p>

<p>Now it happened that his seat was close to the
dean&#8217;s, and as they were returning from morning
service, walking down the cloisters, the dean
called to one of the boys to send King to him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>He went at once.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_029.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;How dare you eat strong onions just before
a service?&#8221; demanded the dean, who had been
head-master of one of the big public schools.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
&#8220;Once a schoolmaster always a schoolmaster,&#8221;
which means that when a man has been a schoolmaster,
he always treats every one afterwards,
whether men or boys, just as if they were schoolboys
under him.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you please, sir, I haven&#8217;t been eating
onions,&#8221; replied King.</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you stand there and tell me such
an untruth?&#8221; said the dean. &#8220;Do you suppose I
cannot smell? I say you have been eating onions,
and the odour is very nasty indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, I have not really eaten any onions,&#8221;
said King.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Do you persist in telling me such a
falsehood. You shall be punished at once. Mr.
Harmer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said the master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give this boy at once a good caning. He
has dared to tell me a lie and persist in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the dean said this, he walked away.</p>

<p>When Mr. Harmer was about to cape King,
the boy said he really had not been eating onions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can smell them,&#8221; said the master.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve got on my coat,&#8221; replied
King.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you get it on your coat?&#8221;</p>

<p>King explained, but the master caned him all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the same, saying it served him right for playing
practical jokes on a little boy. King felt very
angry with Alfred, as if he had been the cause of
his punishment.</p>

<p>It would be well for all boys, when they are
going to play jokes on others, to think how they
would like them if turned against themselves.</p>

<p>As Alfred was going home in the afternoon
with Steve, Mr. Cottenham was standing at his
door and called out to them as they passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I want to speak to you
for a few minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went up to him. Alfred readily guessed
why he wanted them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221; he asked Alfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alfred Davidson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Alfred, how did your friends like the
pigeon&#8217;s milk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much, sir. Herbert King got into a row
over it,&#8221; replied Steve laughingly. &#8220;He even
got caned.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve told him about the dean being angry,
because he did not like the smell of onions, and
would not believe what King said; also that Mr.
Harmer would not listen to his excuse, but had
caned him, and said he deserved it, for playing
practical jokes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>&#8220;King is very angry with Alfred now, sir,&#8221;
continued Steve, &#8220;because he thinks it was all
through him that he got into such a row, and he
says he will be even with him yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It served him right,&#8221; remarked Mr. Cottenham,
laughing loudly; &#8220;he has sent boys here before
on fools&#8217; errands, but I don&#8217;t think he will do so
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come,&#8221; said Poll, &#8220;where&#8217;s the bottle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know these boys again?&#8221; said Mr.
Cottenham, rubbing the bird&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; said Poll.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a very clever bird, Mr. Cottenham,&#8221;
said Steve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; replied the chemist, &#8220;and I got it
in a Very peculiar way. If you can come and
have tea with me, I will tell you a short story
of how I got Poll.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir! We will just run home and ask,
and be back in less than ten minutes,&#8221; said Steve.</p>

<p>Away ran the two boys, and in much less than
ten minutes they were back again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wipe your boots!&#8221; said the parrot. &#8220;Come,
Joe, hurry up!&#8221;</p>

<p>A lady entered, so the boys waited a few
minutes while Mr. Cottenham attended to her.
They looked at the parrot, who kept turning its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
head, first to one side and then to the other,
chuckling as it did so.</p>

<p>Mr. Cottenham told them to go into his parlour
at the back of the shop; behind it was a
large garden, which ran down to the river. The
chemist was very fond of gardening; his garden
was always neat and trim, and full of flowers,
according to the season of the year. There was
a door which opened from the parlour into the
garden, and they could see a dog chained up.
It was a big collie, and it wagged its tail when it
saw Steve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rover,&#8221; called Steve to the dog through the
open window, &#8220;good doggie!&#8221; Rover barked
and frisked about.</p>

<p>Stephen Gray&#8217;s father was an intimate friend
of Mr. Cottenham, and Steve had often had
tea with him. Mr. Cottenham was a bachelor,
and his chief companion was his parrot. He
was very fond of music, and played the
fiddle well, and he usually assisted when there
was a grand festival at the cathedral. Stephen
Gray&#8217;s father was a solo-bass in the choir, and
also played the violoncello.</p>

<p>Mr. Cottenham brought in Poll, took it out
of its cage, and put it on the bar of its stand,
when it began to chatter again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>&#8220;Poor Poll wants some cake. Oh dear! oh
dear! where&#8217;s the sugar?&#8221; said the bird.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Poll,&#8221; observed the chemist, &#8220;you must
not talk, as I don&#8217;t want to be interrupted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Poll wants some cake,&#8221; said the bird.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Poll shall have some,&#8221; said Mr. Cottenham,
picking out a piece, while the bird watched
every movement. &#8220;Now, Poll, draw a cork, and
then you shall have this piece of cake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poll made a wonderful imitation of the popping
of a cork and the gurgling sound of liquid
being poured out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Poll, sneeze!&#8221; said its master.</p>

<p>Poll jumped up and down, and sneezed, and
then laughed exactly like a human being. Mr.
Cottenham&#8217;s parrot was known for miles round,
and children would come to his shop on purpose
to hear it talk.</p>

<p>A customer entered the shop, and Poll called
out &#8220;Shop!&#8221; Mr. Cottenham went, and returned
in a few minutes.</p>

<p>The boys had a hearty tea. &#8220;Now, would you
like to hear how it was I bought Poll?&#8221; said
their host.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, very much,&#8221; said both of the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was seven years ago last autumn, when I
was out some distance from here, going for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
walk across country. I am very fond of a good
walk, and often go out all day when I take
a holiday. It was very hot, and so I had my
big white umbrella, as I don&#8217;t care what people
think or say. I like to be comfortable if I can.
It was rather difficult on that day to feel very
comfortable, though, as the sun was shining not
only brightly, but nearly as hot as I have felt it
in India.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_035.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>&#8220;Have you been in India, sir?&#8221; asked Steve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Steve, I was in a government medical
store for five years when I was quite a young
man. Well, I have never felt in India so hot as
I felt on that particular day. I like warm
weather, and feel as lively as a kitten when it
is hot. What are you laughing at? You think
I am rather too big to be a kitten?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; replied Steve, laughing, &#8220;just a
little bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I will say as lively as an elephant.
They can be lively at times; for you must not
judge of an elephant by what you see in a circus
procession in this cold country. To return to
my tale. I was just a bit too hot to feel as lively
as a kitten or an elephant on that particular day,
but still I was enjoying myself. I had my
dinner at a country inn, and then walked into a
wood and lay down, and went fast asleep. When
I woke up I found that it was getting late,
so I determined to take a short cut across the
country to the railway-station, and save about
two miles. I got up and walked on for some
time, when the sky became overcast, and it got
darker and darker. In fact, it was nearly as
dark as night, and I had great difficulty in
tracing out the right path. I had left the high-road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
for some time, and felt certain that I could
not mistake the direction, as I had been twice
before by the same way. After walking for an
hour, a few big spots of rain fell. I knew that
there would be a thunderstorm soon, and so I
got out into the open country, as it is dangerous
to walk near trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I have heard father say,&#8221; remarked
Alfred. &#8220;He has told me if ever I should be
overtaken by a thunderstorm never to get near
a tree, but to lie down in the open, if there are
no houses near.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite right, Alfred,&#8221; said Mr. Cottenham.
&#8220;There is rarely any danger if you do
so. Mind you never get into a cart-shed where
the front is all open, if there are any iron implements
such as a plough in it. Lightning
always strikes the highest object, or one which
is a good conductor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A good conductor is something, Alfred,
through which electricity can easily pass. For
instance, glass will not let electricity pass
through it, but wire, whether it is copper or
iron, will readily conduct it. You know that
lightning is electricity from the clouds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Steve, who wished him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
continue the tale, not being so desirous of gaining
knowledge as his younger friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see; what was I saying?&#8221; observed
Mr. Cottenham.</p>

<p>&#8220;You said, sir, that you got out in the open
when you heard the thunder,&#8221; replied Steve,
readily, lest Alfred should ask any more questions
about storms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember. The rain now fell in torrents.
I was wet through and through. The
lightning was very vivid, and the thunder almost
as loud as in India. It was, for England, a
terrible storm. I had completely lost my way,
and walked on, not knowing at all where I was
going. I looked in vain in all directions for a
house or cottage of any kind, in which I could
rest a while, as, although I am a fair walker,
I was very tired. The storm became a little
less severe for a few minutes, but then it came
on worse than ever. The rain again poured, and
I was almost blinded by the lightning. Suddenly
I heard a loud whistle, and a voice called out&mdash;&#8216;Look
out!&#8217; I paused, and stood still a moment,
when a very bright flash lighted up all around.
Imagine my surprise and horror when I saw that
I was on the very edge of a deep old mine. One
more step, and I must have been killed. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
a moment I stood still, looking at the dark pit,
then I felt very thankful for such a providential
escape, and looked round to see who had called
out and thus saved my life. I could see no one;
but another flash of lightning showed me a
cottage only a few yards off. I went to it,
and after knocking at the door, was let in. I
asked if I might stay until the storm left off.
They said &#8216;Yes&#8217;, at once, and gave me some
supper and dried my coat. While I was eating
the food, the wife said to her husband, &#8216;Where&#8217;s
Polly?&#8217; &#8216;Outside, I suppose,&#8217; he replied. &#8216;I had
quite forgotten her.&#8217; He went out and brought
in a gray parrot, which was wet through. No
sooner did Poll come in than it began to shake
its feathers, and, putting its head on one side,
while it looked at me, said &#8216;Look out!&#8217; I knew
that it was the parrot&#8217;s timely warning that had
saved my life, and so I determined to buy it.
I gave the miner five pounds for it, and I would
not sell it for fifty pounds. Now you know,
boys, why I value Polly so much, and should still
value it, even if it could not speak so well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Polly had been listening very intently, and when
Mr. Cottenham had finished, it said, &#8220;Look out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Poll,&#8221; said its master, &#8220;I did look out,
or I should not be here to say so, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>As he stroked his pet, the bird perched on his
shoulder and ate a piece of sugar out of his
hand; then it rested on one foot, and blinked its
eyes, as if ready to go to sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Polly is ready for bed,&#8221; said the bird, and
away it flew off to its place for the night, which
was on a shelf, and it was soon asleep.</p>

<p>The boys thanked Mr. Cottenham for his tale,
and for their tea, and accepted an invitation to
come again another day, and bring Walter Parker
with them.</p>

<small>ALFRED AT THE DEANERY.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Alfred was on his way to school in
the afternoon, he saw King and Cox a
little way ahead, so he ran after them.</p>

<p>&#8220;King,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am so sorry that you got
into a row yesterday. I did not know what
pigeon&#8217;s milk was, or I should have told you.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he said this he held out his hand, as he
wanted to be friends with all the boys if possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want you, you young sneak, so
clear off, or I shall give you some strap-oil of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the right sort,&#8221; exclaimed King, who was very
angry.</p>

<p>Alfred moved away, and was soon afterwards
joined by his friends Steve and Walter. Steve
had just been telling Walter all about Mr. Cottenham&#8217;s
clever parrot, and how it had saved his life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alfred, what were you talking to King
about?&#8221; inquired Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only told him how sorry I was that he had
been punished through me, and that I wanted to
shake hands and be friends,&#8221; replied Alfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Through you! It served him right,&#8221; said
Walter; &#8220;he is far too fond of bullying boys
who are smaller than he is. I am very glad
that he will be leaving at midsummer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; said Steve; &#8220;I never did like him,
and he has never liked me. He always was
fond of playing jokes on new boys. Last year,
in May, he persuaded a boy to climb over an
orchard-wall to get him some apples. The silly
boy came from a big town, and he did not know
that there is no fruit on the trees until the
autumn, so over the wall he went. A man caught
him and beat him, and when the boy told King
of it he only laughed at him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The boy is Francis Day; you know him,
Alfred, he sits opposite you,&#8221; said Walter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>&#8220;Yes; he is a very quiet boy, isn&#8217;t he? He
always does his work well.&#8221;</p>

<p>While they were in school, Alfred forgot all
about King and Cox, and worked well at his
tasks. Cox sat close to him, and was doing
some sums. He did the same as Alfred, and
seemed to be quite as hard at work.</p>

<p>Dr. Phillips entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Harmer,&#8221; he said, &#8220;can you spare, for a
few minutes, two of the boys?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Dr. Phillips,&#8221; replied the master;
&#8220;which of them do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want two boys to sing some solos at an &#8216;At
Home&#8217; which the dean is going to give shortly,
and he said he would like to hear their songs now,
as he will be going to London to-night for several
days. I think I should prefer Parker and Davidson.
King, I am afraid your voice is breaking,
and you would not be able to sing the high notes
with certainty.&#8221;</p>

<p>King turned red and looked very much disappointed.
Dr. Phillips was a very clever musician,
and trained the boys not only with great skill,
but also with great patience. They all liked him,
and Alfred&#8217;s ambition was to be an organist such
as he was. Alfred could play the piano very well
for a boy, and the reason why he had made such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
satisfactory progress was because he practised
regularly. When his mother used to tell him to
practise an hour twice a day, instead of grumbling
and doing it very badly he did his best,
and he was glad now that he had done so, as
Mr. Harmer said he might play on the school
harmonium if he liked, and he would help him.
Mr. Harmer also was a very good organist; he
had sometimes played the organ when Dr.
Phillips was away, or conducting an orchestra.</p>

<p>Alfred was very pleased and very proud when
he heard his name mentioned, but Cox looked as
much disappointed as King.</p>

<p>&#8220;Parker and Davidson, you can go with Dr.
Phillips,&#8221; said Mr. Harmer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I shall not be able to send them
back, Mr. Harmer, until after service,&#8221; said Dr.
Phillips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good, there is only the writing lesson
and dictation after they have done their sums,
and they both spell very well,&#8221; replied the master.</p>

<p>Alfred and Walter went with Dr. Phillips, and
were led into the dean&#8217;s drawing-room, where
there were several ladies.</p>

<p>&#8220;These are the boys, Mr. Dean,&#8221; said Dr.
Phillips.</p>

<p>Both boys stood shyly near the door, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
dean&#8217;s daughter came and shook hands with
them, and told them to take a seat near the
piano, while she played over the accompaniment.
She was so pretty and so kind that Alfred soon
got over his shyness, and sang the pieces which
she wished him to try, very well.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has a very powerful voice for so small
a boy,&#8221; remarked the dean. &#8220;He is training for
a solo-boy, is he not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; replied Dr. Phillips, &#8220;and I think
he will be one of the best I have ever had in the
choir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ladies were all very much pleased with his
clear voice, and asked him many questions about
his parents and his home.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall want you both to sing at my &#8216;At
Home&#8217;, and also at a concert we are arranging in
connection with the missionary society,&#8221; said the
dean&#8217;s daughter. &#8220;I hope you are both good
boys at school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We try to be so&mdash;at least, sometimes we do,
ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, Miss Rivers,&#8221; said Dr. Phillips, &#8220;they
are very good boys, that is, <i>for boys</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say your father was?&#8221; an
elderly lady asked Alfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;An engineer, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; replied Alfred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_045.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;My husband is one of the directors of that
line,&#8221; she remarked, after asking him on what
ship his father was serving, &#8220;and I remember his
mentioning a very clever piece of work your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
father did when some of the machinery went
wrong. My husband was on board at the time,
and during a terrible storm some part of the
engine broke down. I do not know what part
it was, as I do not understand engines, although
I ought to, as my husband is so often talking
about them. Your father, at the risk of his
life, repaired the engine, and saved not only the
ship, but the passengers also. Where is your
father now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He went a few weeks ago, ma&#8217;am, on another
voyage,&#8221; replied Alfred. &#8220;This is his first voyage
for more than six months, as he has been very
ill. He got hurt, ma&#8217;am, in that storm, but he&#8217;s
better now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My husband also has been ill since; so much
so, that he is only just able now to resume his
duties. He is going to ask the other directors
to reward your father for his bravery and
skill. What does your mother do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has been teaching at a school while
father was ill, as we had no money left, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can it be possible? How neglectful we
have been! My husband always intended that
your father should be rewarded, but while you
have been so badly off, we have been thinking of
ourselves only. I must write down your address,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and my husband and I will call and see your
mother this week. I hope your father is quite
well now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t quite well, ma&#8217;am, but he is better,
and said he thought the voyage would do him
good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope it will, I am sure,&#8221; replied the lady.
&#8220;Here, take this, little boy, and give that to the
other boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This&#8221; was half-a-crown. Alfred looked at
it with surprise. He had never had more than
a shilling at a time to spend, and thought himself
quite rich with that amount. How happy he
felt when he pictured what he could buy with it
for his mother and for Maggie, who was three
years older than he!</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys,&#8221; said Dr. Phillips, &#8220;we must be
moving, or we shall be late for service. You are
taking the solo, aren&#8217;t you, Parker?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys went away with Dr. Phillips, and
Alfred thought he had never enjoyed a service so
much before; he certainly had never sung better.</p>

<p>When the service was over, the boys went
home, as there were no more lessons that day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steve,&#8221; said Walter, as they were walking
from the cathedral, &#8220;we&#8217;ve been in luck.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Steve.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had half-a-crown each given to us by
a lady at the deanery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you buy an induction-coil now
at Mr. Cottenham&#8217;s?&mdash;you&#8217;ve got batteries&mdash;and
then we can do some experiments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; said Walter, &#8220;I am game. You
had better buy one as well, Alfred, and then we
can make a very strong current.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alfred did not reply, and away they ran as
quickly as they could to spend the money.</p>

<p>Mr. Cottenham was not in the shop, so the
parrot whistled and called out &#8220;Shop!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Cottenham came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, boys, what do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of those half-crown induction-coils,
please, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>He got one out for them, and soon showed
Walter how to use it. Walter was very fond of
science, and all his spare pocket-money was spent
with Mr. Cottenham, who not only encouraged
the boy, but helped him, and gave him quite
as much as he bought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Alfred, do you want one too?&#8221; he
inquired, seeing the half-crown in the boy&#8217;s
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>&#8220;What are you going to do with your money?
Put it in the savings-bank, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir; I am going to send it home to mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Alfred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want a pill?&#8221; said Poll, who had been
watching the boys very intently without speaking.</p>

<p>The coil having been bought, the boys were
just going away, when Mr. Cottenham invited
them all to come the following evening to tea,
promising to show them some experiments in
chemistry and electricity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; replied Walter, his eyes
beaming with pleasure. &#8220;We will all come as
early as we can. Good-evening, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; cried out Poll.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you, Polly,&#8221; said Walter, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t much home-work, Walter,&#8221; said
Steve, &#8220;can we come in and see your electrical
apparatus to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, do; you come also, Alfred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Walter; I should very much like
to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later in the evening the two boys were watching
Walter, who had made some mechanical toys,
which he worked with his batteries. There were
two windmills, a pump, and a small engine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Walter wanted to be an electrical engineer or a
chemist. He gave them some shocks with his
coil.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Walter,&#8221; exclaimed Steve, &#8220;what a
lark it would be to put your batteries on to the
door-handle, so when the boys tried to open the
door they would get a tremendous shock!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Walter; &#8220;I have never thought
of that. We will take them to-morrow. You
can carry one, while I take the other with the
coils.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they separated for the night.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE next morning Alfred got up very early
to write a letter to his mother and tell
her all the news, and at the same time send the
half-crown. He had stayed longer than he
intended with Walter, and had to go to bed
directly he came in. He sat down in his bedroom
with his pen and ink and wrote with letters
very well formed, but rather big, the following
letter:&mdash;</p>

here and scratched his head. He thought

Then he went back again and altered the words,
wondering how he could be so silly. The first
word he altered with a big blot, and put &#8220;their&#8221;,
and the second &#8220;there&#8221;. Again he continued.)
<i>He has bought a coil with half-a-crown, but
I have sent mine to you, because I knew you
would be pleased. A lady gave us both each
half-a-crown. She is coming to see you. Her
husband was in the ship when father mended
the engin, and he is going to get father a reward
for saving his life. The parrot saved Mr.
Cottenham&#8217;s life, and he likes it very much. It
is very clever, and can talk just like a real man
or boy. It says funny things. I am just going
to have my brekfast, and I am going off to
school with them, and they are going to take their
batterys with them there, so no more now.</i></p>

<p class="gap"><i>Your loving son and brother</i>,</p>

<p class="right"><i>ALFIE</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then there were a number of crosses to signify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
kisses, and quite as many blots and smudges,
which Alfred did not mean to signify anything
in particular.</p>

<p>If Mr. Harmer had seen the letter he would
have told Alfred that &#8220;breakfast&#8221; is the way to
spell the word, and that when words end in &#8220;y&#8221;
with a consonant before the &#8220;y&#8221;, you must change
the &#8220;y&#8221; into &#8220;ies&#8221; for the plural. For a small
boy Alfred usually spelt very well except when
he was careless.</p>

<p>There was a post-office at Mr. Cottenham&#8217;s,
for the general post-office was a long way off, so
after breakfast Alfred went into his shop to buy
a stamp with one of the few pennies he had.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, will you give me a penny stamp?&#8221;
he said, putting a bright penny on the counter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, I will give you one, Alfred,&#8221; replied
Mr. Cottenham. &#8220;Have you written home
to your mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, and I have sent her the half-crown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see your letter. You must not send
money in an envelope like that without registering
the letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alfred did not know what that meant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Alfred, it costs twopence more, and then
the postman takes care of it so that it shall not
get stolen or be lost.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>&#8220;Please, sir, I have a penny a week pocket-money,
and I will bring you two more pennies
presently. I have got four at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a good boy,&#8221; said Mr. Cottenham,
&#8220;so I will register it, and pay the postage for you
as well. Give me the letter, I will take care of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alfred thanked him for his kindness, and ran
off with a light heart to school. He did not
meet Steve or Walter, as they were arranging
how they could fix the batteries so as to give
each boy a shock as he entered. Unfortunately
for them the first to enter was Mr. Harmer, who
received a slight shock, but not so great as theirs
when they saw him come in.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, only a little fun. I didn&#8217;t think
you would be here yet, sir,&#8221; said Walter, looking
very foolish, and feeling quite as foolish as he
looked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am surprised at you, Parker, doing such a
thing. You ought to set the boys a good example,
as you help me with them. It is the first time
you have ever done such a silly thing, so I will
say no more this time, but I shall keep your
batteries for the rest of this month. I think
that will be quite punishment enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Harmer took away both the batteries, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the coil as well, while Walter and Steve slunk
away, feeling very small at the failure of their
little joke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Walter,&#8221; said Steve, &#8220;what will Mr. Cottenham
say to-night if you tell him that you have
not brought your batteries?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had forgotten that,&#8221; replied Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s ask Mr. Harmer just to give them back
to us for this once; perhaps he will,&#8221; suggested
Steve.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know he won&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Walter. &#8220;Whatever
he says he always sticks to, so it would not
be any good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter was quite right in his opinion of Mr.
Harmer, as he was a man who did stick to what
he said. If he said a boy should do an imposition,
all the tears and entreaties in the world would
not move him.</p>

<p>After the roll-call Mr. Harmer set the boys
their lessons, and then called Alfred up to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Davidson,&#8221; he said, &#8220;come here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alfred left his seat and went up to the master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know that you left your sum-book
on the desk when you went away yesterday
with Dr. Phillips?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, I am very sorry, but I quite forgot
all about it. I won&#8217;t do it again, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>&#8220;Do you know what the imposition is for
leaving books about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, three sums.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you must do three sums. I never
excuse a boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alfred stood still.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know any other reason why I called
you here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; replied Alfred, not remembering
having done any wrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just think a minute,&#8221; said the master, looking
at him very closely. &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t your conscience
tell you the reason?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir,&#8221; said Alfred, ready to cry, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know anything wrong that I&#8217;ve done. I
don&#8217;t really, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at this sum. Tell me how many seven
and nine make?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sixteen, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why do you put fourteen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry, sir, I was so careless. I really
will try not to do so again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have made another mistake in the same
sum. You have added the farthings up incorrectly,
and have put one halfpenny, when it
should be three farthings.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>&#8220;Shall I do the sum again, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not yet finished, Davidson,&#8221; continued
Mr. Harmer. &#8220;What is strangest of all is, that
your result, thus incorrectly done, should be the
right answer. If you had added up the figures
correctly, your answer would have been wrong.
That is very strange, is it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; replied Alfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know that I don&#8217;t allow any boy
to use an arithmetic book with answers at the
back of the book?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then how dare you use one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, I have not done so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you stand there and tell me that
falsehood? Do you see this?&#8221;</p>

<p>The master held up a page of answers, evidently
torn out of an arithmetic book, which
had all the answers at the back.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been squaring your sums so as to
make the answers right. I can understand now
why you helped Cox, and why he sent that note
asking for your help again. I thought that he
alone was to blame in the matter, but this makes
me change my opinion. Where do you suppose
I found this sheet of answers?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alfred did not reply, as he was too much
frightened and surprised.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>&#8220;Leave off crying!&#8221; said Mr. Harmer angrily.
&#8220;Your tears will not save you. You have been
a very deceitful boy, and I shall punish you
severely. Cox, come here!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cox went up to his master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has Davidson helped you before with these
answers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; replied Cox, without hesitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that the reason why you asked him to
help you the other day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that I forbid the use of answers,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I shall punish you both. You will stay
in during every interval this week. Go to your
seat. Davidson, you will also stay in during
every interval this week, and come to me again
directly after the afternoon service.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Alfred returned to his seat King
whispered to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;You got me a caning the other day, and now
you are in for one yourself, you little sneak! I
hope Mr. Harmer will make you smart like he
did me, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a sad day for Alfred. The service in
the cathedral, which was one of the pleasures of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
his life, he could not enjoy. His friends, Walter
and Steve, tried to make the best of it, but it was
no good. He spent most of the time in tears,
the hours seemed so long; and when he went
alone into the school-room, after the afternoon
service, it was with beating heart and trembling
limbs. Mr. Harmer was not there, and he had to
wait some minutes.</p>

<p>The door opened, and King and Cox put their
heads round and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be in your shoes for anything,&#8221;
said King. &#8220;Now you know how I felt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then both of the boys laughed. Alfred remained
in his seat and did not even look up.
Suddenly the boys, hearing the master coming,
ran away.</p>

<p>Mr. Harmer walked up to his desk. Alfred
heard him open it and get out his cane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Davidson, come here!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, won&#8217;t you believe me?&#8221; he pleaded,
sobbing bitterly. &#8220;I did not, sir, I really did not
use those answers. I know you will hurt me, but
I don&#8217;t mind that if you will only believe me, sir.
Please, do this once, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>Alfred could not speak any more. The master
stood, cane in hand, and looked at him. His
memory went back to his boyhood, and he remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
how he had once stood before his
master pleading, as Alfred was pleading at that
moment; and he recollected, too, how he had
been punished severely, and his innocence proved
some months after. Yes, he remembered all this,
and that his heart-broken grief did not move his
master. He was disgraced until it was proved
that he had spoken the truth. He hesitated.
Masters do sometimes err in judgment, but it is
not often, and he could not believe that Alfred
was a boy who would tell a lie and persist in it.
He looked at the boy crying, and then put his
cane down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Davidson,&#8221; he said kindly, &#8220;I will believe
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you, sir, thank you! I don&#8217;t
mind being caned now, at least not so much.
You have made me so happy, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I forgive a boy, Davidson, I entirely
forgive him; so I shall not cane you. I shall
wait and watch, and I shall find out some day
who used those answers. You must stay in
during the interval to-morrow to do three sums
for leaving your books about. I will accept no
excuses for breaking rules.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; replied Alfred, looking at
his master.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>&#8220;You may go now, my boy,&#8221; said Mr. Harmer,
patting his rough, curly hair.</p>

<p>Alfred ran off. All his grief went at once.
Outside the door he met his two friends, who
were waiting for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did it hurt much?&#8221; inquired Steve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Harmer has believed me,&#8221; replied Alfred
with joy, &#8220;and I am so happy now! He has not
caned me. I have only got to do three sums for
leaving my books about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad,&#8221; exclaimed Walter, with emphasis.
&#8220;I believe some one else put those answers in
your book, purposely to get you in a row, while
we were with the dean. I&#8217;ll try to find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do now, Alfred?&#8221;
inquired Steve. &#8220;Will you come for a walk
with us? We don&#8217;t go to Mr. Cottenham&#8217;s until
half-past five.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you, Steve,&#8221; replied Alfred. &#8220;I
shall run home and wash my face, and just write
a letter home to my mother and tell her everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; said Walter. &#8220;We will call for
you about a quarter-past five.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks!&#8221; said Alfred, and away he ran, as
happy as he had been miserable before, to write
home.</p>

<small>THE PAPER-CHASE.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">TWO days after this, Alfred received a letter
from his mother which made him very
happy. The letter said that his father would be
back in about a fortnight, and would have time
to come home for a few days before going away
again. His father was much better, and he was
coming with his mother, and Maggie as well, to
see Alfred and hear him sing in the fine old
cathedral. Was not Alfred glad when he read
that!</p>

<p>He was so pleased, that he read it again and
again. It was a long letter, and there was something
else in it. The lady whom Alfred had
met at the deanery had called upon his mother,
and her husband was coming with her to see
Alfred&#8217;s father directly he returned.</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that Alfred showed this
letter to both his friends, and even to Mr. Cottenham,
who met him near the cathedral.</p>

<p>Walter said he would try to find out who put
the answers in Alfred&#8217;s book; both Steve and
he believed that it was either King or Cox.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Walter thought that Cox used answers, as he
was a dunce at sums, and that King had either
put the page in Alfred&#8217;s book, or had told Cox to
do so. He knew that the answers would only be
used by a boy who was weak in sums, and who
was doing practice, as the answers were for that
part of the arithmetic book. King was good at
arithmetic and much more advanced, so that the
answers would not be of any use to him. There
were two other boys who sat at the same desk
as Alfred and Cox, and one of them was doing
practice also, but the other was quite a little boy
who had not got so far. So Walter thought
that it must be either Cox or the other boy,
whose name was Frank Pitt.</p>

<p>On the previous day Cox could not get his
sums right, and had been kept in, while Frank
Pitt&#8217;s were all right. He could not doubt that it
was Cox alone who wanted the answers to help
him, and so he determined to watch him.</p>

<p>Walter taught all the smallest boys, who were
called probationers. As their name explains,
they came on trial, and if they did well and
behaved themselves they became choir-boys, if
not, they had to leave. Now one of these little
boys, Thomas Brown, was the fourth boy who
sat at Alfred&#8217;s desk, and during the interval,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Walter thought he would ask him a few questions,
as he sat next to Cox.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tommy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;does Cox ever help you
with your sums?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Brown, &#8220;he can&#8217;t do his own
always.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can he do them sometimes, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he gets them done quickly sometimes,
but at other times he keeps making figures and
crossing them out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does anyone help him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He told me that King does sometimes in the
evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was all that Walter said at the moment,
as he did not wish to let Brown suspect anything.</p>

<p>During school, Mr. Young came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Harmer,&#8221; he said, &#8220;as the weather is so
fine and warm, I should like to arrange a paper-chase
for the boys to-morrow morning directly
after service. I am going to give them all a
good dinner at Brangton, and we will come back
by train in time for the afternoon service. We
ought to get to Brangton by one, following the
hares, and then we shall have an hour and a quarter
for dinner and be back before three o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good, Mr. Young,&#8221; replied Mr. Harmer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
&#8220;If the day should be as fine as it is to-day, they
will all enjoy it very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come as well, or would you rather
not walk so far?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you really do not mind, I think I should
prefer to go by train and meet you there, Mr.
Young.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, boys, I hope you will not forget to be
in the cloisters punctually for the start. I have
plenty of paper ready for the chase.&#8221;</p>

<p>In one moment every boy&#8217;s tongue was let
loose, and they were talking to each other about
the chase, while Mr. Harmer and Mr. Young
arranged the details.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence, boys!&#8221; said Mr. Harmer; &#8220;who will
be the hares?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;King and Gray are the quickest runners,&#8221;
said Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mr. Young, &#8220;I know they can run
well; so can Cox and Pitt. Then let King and
Gray be the hares. Now, boys, get on with your
work again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Young went away, and the boys again
turned their minds to their work, and were as
busy as bees, or at least they looked as if they
were. When they were free, nothing was talked
about except the paper-chase.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>The following day was fine, and directly after
morning service in the cathedral all the boys
were ready. Mr. Young soon joined them, and
gave King and Stephen each a bag of torn paper.
Off they started, crossing the bridge and making
for a wood which lay in the direction of Brangton,
about a mile from the cathedral. Brangton
was a pretty village, with a railway-station, about
five miles away.</p>

<p>Mr. Harmer took three very small boys with
him by rail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys,&#8221; said Mr. Young, as the cathedral
clock struck, &#8220;it is time for us to start.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cox and Walter led the boys, while Mr. Young,
who could walk and run well, came with the others.
Alfred trotted well and soon came up with Walter.</p>

<p>The trail was not difficult to follow until they
got right into the woods, when they wandered
about for some minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here it is, Walter,&#8221; cried out Alfred. &#8220;They
have crossed this ditch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter ran up and jumped over the ditch,
followed by the rest and Mr. Young. Now they
ran across a meadow, and then over a ploughed
field and up a lane. They had not yet seen
either of the hares, and already one hour was
gone. They halted for a few minutes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>&#8220;Well, Parker,&#8221; said Mr. Young, &#8220;have you
lost the trail again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir. I can see the paper along the side
of the hedge. They have crossed this brook.&#8221;</p>

<p>The brook was at least twelve feet wide, and
about four feet deep where they were.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, sir!&#8221; said Cox; &#8220;they have leaped over
it and thrown the pole down on the other
side.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Young glanced in the direction in which
he pointed, and saw a long pole lying near the
water, and the trail across the field on the other
side of the brook.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a wooden bridge about a quarter of
a mile up the stream. Those of you who can&#8217;t
jump over must go round,&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Young,
who took a short run and easily cleared the
brook. &#8220;Here&#8217;s the pole for any who care to try
and follow me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Most of the boys had already made for the
bridge. Walter, Cox, and Frank Pitt alone
leaped over the brook by the help of the pole.
Alfred had gone with the others. Again they
all followed the trail. Brangton was in sight,
and if the hares reached the farmhouse before
they were caught, they would win the chase.
Walter, with Cox and Pitt, now made a final<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
spurt, and saw Steve and King quietly sitting
down about a quarter of a mile ahead.</p>

<p>They got up and waved their caps in derision,
and then darted off, all the others following as
fast as they could. It was rather a hopeless
task. The hares slackened speed, but as soon as
Walter, Cox, and Pitt came within a few yards
of them, they ran away again, laughing at them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys, I think I can catch them,&#8221; said
Mr. Young, who was a very swift runner.</p>

<p>The hares saw him coming and gaining rapidly
on them, so they ran into a sweet-shop, through
the house, into the garden, and over the wall,
and then made for the farmhouse, not a hundred
yards ahead. Mr. Young had gone round, and
was only about ten yards behind. King he
succeeded in overtaking, but Steve got into the
house first. The rest came in a few minutes later.</p>

<p>Mr. Harmer was waiting for them, and so was
a good dinner also. The boys were hungry,
and the good people of the farm thought that
they would never be able to satisfy their
appetites.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you bought railway tickets, sir?&#8221; inquired
the farmer.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Robinson, not yet,&#8221; replied Mr.
Young.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>&#8220;Because there&#8217;s a wagon going back that
you might all ride in, if you like, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Robinson; but I am afraid
we should not be back in time for service, as we
should be over an hour if we rode in that. The
service is at three, and it is now nearly two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had forgot about the sarvice, sir. You&#8217;ll go
back by the two-twenty train, I suppose, then,
sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that is the train I intend to return by.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys sang grace after the meal, and then
walked down to the station and returned by the
train, having enjoyed their run immensely.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are much obliged to you, sir,&#8221; said
Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite sure, Walter,&#8221; replied Mr. Young,
&#8220;that none of you have enjoyed the run more
than I have. We must arrange another before
it is too hot.&#8221;</p>

<p>They marched in a very orderly manner to
the cathedral and joined heartily in the service,
after which they went to their homes to do their
work for the next morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;King,&#8221; Walter heard Cox say, &#8220;will you
come home with me and give me a hand with
those sums? I can&#8217;t do them now I&#8217;ve lost my
help.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>Walter was standing behind one of the pillars
in the cloister, and Cox did not see him, although
King did.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on with me, Harry,&#8221; said King, running
off.</p>

<p>Walter decided in his own mind that the
&#8220;help&#8221; must be the answers he had used, but he
could not, of course, be sure about it, so he said
nothing to Steve or Alfred then, but resolved to
wait until he could be sure.</p>

<p>The three boys had an invitation to go to Mr.
Cottenham&#8217;s to tea once a week, on Thursdays.
He had promised on their next visit to show
them some more experiments, so they went home
to do their work first, as he said he would
always have tea later, in order that they might
be able to spend an hour or so with him without
neglecting their lessons.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>AT MR. COTTENHAM&#8217;S.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MR. COTTENHAM was unable to show them
the experiments he had promised, as he
was engaged all the evening, so they went home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
after tea. A week later they again went to see
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was very sorry, Walter,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to disappoint
you last week; but I have everything
ready this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care!&#8221; said the parrot; &#8220;wipe your
boots!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A very good hint!&#8221; laughed Mr. Cottenham.</p>

<p>As it was a lovely April day, and quite warm,
they had tea in the summer-house. Mr. Cottenham
was very proud of his garden, in which he
spent most of his leisure time, working very hard
to keep it tidy and full of the best flowers of
the season. There were already many flowers
in bloom, and the view across the river towards
the grand old cathedral was very fine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steve,&#8221; he said, when they were about to sit
down to tea together&mdash;Poll was also there, and
Alfred had gone to fetch Rover, the big dog,
from his kennel&mdash;&#8220;Steve, when I was in the old
book-shop, looking at some works on gardening,
one of your boys came in; his name, I think, is
Cox; his father is agent for an insurance company.
He is about your height, and has red
hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, that is Harry Cox,&#8221; replied Steve.</p>

<p>&#8220;What arithmetic do you use?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>Steve named the book they used.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alfred told me all about the trouble he got
into with Mr. Harmer, when he found a page of
answers to his sums in his exercise book,&#8221; said Mr.
Cottenham. &#8220;When I heard a boy ask for an
arithmetic book with answers, and saw that it
was one of your boys, I noted what occurred.
Mr. Thrupp, the bookseller, found him a copy,
and told him it would be two shillings. It was
a second-hand book. He bought it and took it
away with him. I did not say anything, but
you, Walter and Steve, should watch and see if
his sums are right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will, sir,&#8221; replied Walter, &#8220;and we are
much obliged to you for telling us. I think
either he or Herbert King put the answers in
Alfred&#8217;s book to spite him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say a word to Alfred until you are
sure about it; but I thought if I told you, it
might lead to the discovery of the boy who
used the answers. Here comes Alfred with
Rover.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rover came in, jumping about, and threatening
to break all the cups and saucers, until his
master told him to lie down. Poll amused
itself by whistling and calling the dog, but after
the first time Rover was not deceived, and merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
looked at the bird as if he wondered how it did it.</p>

<p>Mr. Cottenham always had plenty of anecdotes
to tell the boys of his adventures in India,
as he had been a keen sportsman and crack
shot. He was now an officer in the local volunteers,
and by far the best shot in the regiment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You promised once, sir,&#8221; said Steve, &#8220;to tell
us an anecdote about a tiger-hunt you once had
in India.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I?&#8221; replied Mr. Cottenham; &#8220;then I must
keep my word. I shall never forget that adventure.
Although it was very dangerous, it was
also very funny, and I believe I laughed more
than I trembled at the time. I was in charge of
one of the government stores in a distant part,
where there were but few Englishmen, although
there was a regiment of native infantry and a
squadron of cavalry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our work up there was much the same day
after day, so I was as much excited at the prospect
of a change as you are. The captain in
command of the cavalry came in one morning
and asked me if I should like to join him in a
tiger-hunt. A large tiger had been seen in the
neighbourhood, and had carried off a lot of cattle
and a horse. He said he had sent some mounted
men out to scour the country, to see if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
could find out where the animal was. I told
him I should be delighted to join him as soon
as I had finished my official duties. I had a
large store-room, in which the drugs were kept,
and amongst them, some large bottles of ammonia.
I suppose you know that ammonia is
very strong smelling, and is used in smelling-salts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You put some in the pigeon&#8217;s milk, didn&#8217;t
you, sir?&#8221; inquired Alfred, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did, Alfred. Well, I was busily engaged
in looking over the stores and making up some
medicines; but I was thinking about the hunt
we were going to have rather than about the
work I had in hand. My native servant was
occupied in getting both my guns ready, and my
horse as well, as I hoped in an hour to be able to
join the captain, who was about to start. He
called, on horseback, and told me where the tiger
had last been seen, and asked me to come to him
as soon as possible. I told him I would, and I
hurried on with my work, just as you boys do
when you have a holiday directly it is finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had to go into the large warehouse at the
back of the store for some drugs. The warehouse
had four small windows and one door only, which
I always kept locked, as I had had many goods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
stolen. It was very hot, and when I was in the
warehouse I was so warm that I sat down for a
few moments on some mats, just to cool myself
and write down a few notes in my book. I suppose
I must have fallen asleep almost immediately,
as I woke with a start and recollected
the hunting expedition. I looked at my watch,
and you may imagine my surprise and disappointment
when I found that I had been asleep nearly
two hours. I felt very cross with myself, as I
had never yet had an opportunity of joining in
a tiger-hunt. I longed to see the ferocious animal
in his wild native state. So I got up, and
was about to finish my work, when I chanced to
glance towards the doorway. There, in the cool
shade, stretched quite at his ease, lay a huge tiger!</p>



<p>&#8220;I had no weapon, and it was quite impossible
for me to get out of the outhouse without walking
over the savage beast. All this flashed through
my mind in a moment. If I shouted I should
arouse the tiger, which would in all probability
immediately attack me. I was quite defenceless,
and my only hope of safety lay in being absolutely
quiet. You may rest assured I did so,
hoping that my servant might chance to come
round and see where I was; but, as I had told him
he could join the hunt directly he had got my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
guns and horse ready, I had little hope of that.
I suppose that the animal must have been
hunted by the captain and his followers, and,
being tired, had selected that spot for repose.
There were several big boxes behind which I had
been lying, so I was hidden from the tiger&#8217;s view.
My store was outside the village, and stood alone,
so that the tiger was not disturbed. I need hardly
say I could not take my eyes off the beast, which
was apparently fast asleep. I waited for quite
a quarter of an hour, silently watching my uninvited
guest, when suddenly I saw a large bottle
which was labelled <i>Liquor Ammoni Fortiss</i>.
You know sufficient Latin to understand that
<i>fortiss</i>, is the abbreviation for strongest. Noiselessly
I took this big bottle and put it on a
box in front of me. Then I found a small pan,
filled it with the strong ammonia, and hid myself
again behind a big box. The breeze carried
the strong odour towards the tiger&#8217;s nostrils, and
the animal was aroused in a moment. It sniffed
and jumped up, and then sniffed again, as if undecided
what to do. It went up to the pan and
took one sniff at the liquid, then bounded out of
the shed as if it had been shot. I could hardly
help laughing at his sudden disappearance. I
ran quickly into the store and got both my guns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
mounted my horse, and went in the direction in
which I had seen the tiger rush. A few minutes
later I met the captain returning, without having
seen the tiger he had been hunting for. In a
few words I explained what had taken place,
and away we went after my old friend. Well,
boys, to cut a long story short, I had the good
luck to shoot the animal myself, and you must
have seen the skin hanging up in my parlour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the very same, sir?&#8221; asked Steve.
&#8220;It is a very big one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Steve, and it looked much bigger when
alive and lying in that doorway, I can assure
you. Why, boys, you have not been eating and
drinking while I have been talking. What has
become of your appetites?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus reminded, the boys did ample justice to
the food, and after tea they went into Mr.
Cottenham&#8217;s laboratory&mdash;that is, the room in
which he made chemicals or did chemical experiments.
Walter eagerly followed everything
he said and did. Mr. Cottenham explained in a
very clear way all the changes that took place.
He took a glass jar, called a beaker, and put into
it a white powder, which, he said, was called
<i>sugar of lead</i> or <i>acetate of lead</i>. This powder
he dissolved in some water, tied on to a string<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
some pieces of zinc, and fastened the other end of
the string to a glass rod, which he placed across
the top of the beaker. He left this while he was
doing some other experiments, and there was
gradually formed, on the string, a bright, leaf-like
structure, called a lead-tree. He explained
to Walter that the zinc had changed places with
the lead, and was in the liquid, while the lead
was on the string. He took a glass-tube, called
a test-tube, and put into it some more <i>sugar of
lead</i> dissolved in water, and then he took some
little whitish crystals of <i>iodide of potassium</i>,
and mixed the two liquids while warm. When
the mixture was cool there were beautiful crystals,
just like gold, glittering and yellow.
These, he said, were <i>iodide of lead</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I was in India, boys, I made a quantity
of this to amuse myself; and to have a joke, I
put a lot of these crystals in the sandy soil by the
side of a small stream, where the natives often
came for water. I stood at a distance and
watched for a short time, when a terrible
hubbub was raised. There were the men,
women, and children squabbling and grabbing
this gold, as they thought. In one of the papers
it was afterwards said that a quantity of gold
had been discovered, and an engineer and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
government officials came to investigate. I need
hardly say that no gold was found. I did not
tell them how the report had got circulated.
I suppose, boys, I am rather fond of spinning
yarns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that, sir?&#8221; innocently inquired Alfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Alfred, that means telling short stories.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We like them ever so much,&#8221; said Alfred,
&#8220;and we shall remember what you tell us better,
because we can&#8217;t forget your stories&mdash;yarns, I
mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amongst several other experiments which Mr.
Cottenham performed was one in which he took
some powdered sugar and some other white
powder, called <i>chlorate of potash</i>, moistened a
rod in an acid (oil of vitriol) and touched the
mixed powders. Immediately they caught fire,
and all the powder turned black.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind, boys, that you always wash your
hands after touching any chemicals, as many of
them are poisonous, and also, never do any
experiments without first asking, as some things
explode, and might seriously injure you. I had
an accident when I was a boy, through being too
conceited to ask. I thought I knew everything,
and so I made some gas (it was <i>hydrogen</i>), and
lit it without taking the proper precaution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
seeing that there was no air left in the flask.
Immediately there was a loud report like a
pistol-shot, and my apparatus was blown all to
pieces. You see that scar just above my eye.
Well, that was where a piece of glass struck me,
and I am thankful that I did not lose my sight.
Boys too often think that making an explosion
is a big joke, but it is also a very dangerous one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you teach chemistry, sir?&#8221; inquired Alfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, at the grammar-school, and I am going
to ask Mr. Harmer to let me give you a course
of lectures at your school next autumn, similar
to those I give at the grammar-school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please do, sir!&#8221; exclaimed Walter; &#8220;and let
me help you with the experiments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I certainly will, Walter, as it is a
pleasure to teach you chemistry, you take such
an intelligent interest in all I do here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that for, sir?&#8221; inquired Steve, pointing
to a very complicated piece of apparatus.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is for water analysis,&#8221; replied Mr.
Cottenham. &#8220;I am the borough analyst, and
have to test the milk, butter, and anything else
that may be brought to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to be a chemist, sir!&#8221; exclaimed
Walter. &#8220;I hope that when I leave school father
will let me be one.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_081.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>&#8220;Please, sir,&#8221; inquired Steve, &#8220;can you do any
kind of analysis?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Steve,&#8221; replied Mr. Cottenham. &#8220;I
think I may venture to say I can undertake any
analysis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you analyse something for me, sir, which
I should so much like to have done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Steve, with pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, sir, I wish you would kindly do my
grammar analysis for me to-night,&#8221; said Steve,
grinning.</p>

<p>Mr. Cottenham laughed good-humouredly, and
said he feared that he had quite forgotten that
branch of analysis.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the time?&#8221; cried Poll.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys, Polly evidently thinks it is time you
went, and so do I, so good-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys thanked him heartily, and ran off
home at once.</p>

<small>POLLY AT SCHOOL.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">TEN days passed, and Alfred received another
letter from his mother, saying that his
father was expected home in three days&#8217; time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Moreover, the lady he had met at the deanery had
called again, this time with her husband, Mr.
Rogers, and they had promised to repeat the
visit when his father came home. &#8220;<i>Don&#8217;t forget,
Alfie</i>,&#8221; wrote his sister, &#8220;<i>that we hope next week
to come and see you</i>.&#8221; Alfred was not likely to
forget that; he almost counted the hours and
minutes to the day when he should see his father
again.</p>

<p>Steve met him as usual, as he was on his way
to school, and as they passed Mr. Cottenham&#8217;s
shop, he called to them:</p>

<p>&#8220;Steve,&#8221; he said, &#8220;poor Polly&#8217;s gone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; Steve; at least I hope not. Last night
a strange cat came into my parlour, through
the open window, and flew at Polly. I only
heard a noise, and when I came in I saw the
parrot fly through the window, and the cat after
it. I rushed down the garden, but Poll, although
one wing has had a few feathers taken out to
prevent it from flying away, can still fly some
yards at a time&mdash;farther than I thought it could.
I have been out half the night and early again
this morning, but I cannot find any trace of it.
I hope I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t catch that cat until I am less
angry, or it will be a bad job for it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>&#8220;We will look about, sir,&#8221; replied Steve, &#8220;and
run back if we should see it or hear anything
about it. Everybody in the town knows it, I
should think, so I do hope you will get it back
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so too, Steve, I can assure you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys went on to school without seeing
Polly, or meeting anyone who had seen it. They
told their school-fellows, and all of them determined
to join Mr. Cottenham in their spare time
in hunting for the bird.</p>

<p>The dean still retained something of the schoolmaster
about him, and used twice a year to
examine the choir-boys in the school for about
a couple of hours. His visit was always an unexpected
one, and the boys, when assembled after
service, were surprised when he walked in, accompanied
by Mr. Young. All the boys were
afraid of him, not that they need have been, for
although he was a firm believer in discipline, he
was very fond of young people, and boys had at
various times experienced many kindnesses at
his hands. But still, he was the dean, and because
he was the dean, the choir-boys were
always uneasy, to say the least, when the surprise
examination took place. Moreover, if a boy were
very bad and had to be expelled, he was taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
before the dean, and in that light, as a judge, he
was always regarded.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will be sure to be down on me, worse
luck,&#8221; exclaimed King, &#8220;on account of that young
sneak, Davidson!&#8221;</p>

<p>King had been often called &#8220;Onions&#8221; since the
first of April incident, and was always very angry
when anyone used the nickname. He could not
see that side of the joke.</p>

<p>If the boys were anxious, the master was
equally so, as he wished them to show up well
before the dean. This did not always happen,
and work which Mr. Harmer had been through
time after time, they sometimes quite forgot
when they were questioned by the dean. The
unlucky boy, who from inattention had not
learnt his work properly, or from nervousness
was unable to remember, would not only be
reproved by the dean, but, after he had gone,
Mr. Harmer would give him some impositions in
order to help his memory.</p>

<p>Those boys who had been previously examined
remembered this, and that was one reason why
they were always very glad when the dean&#8217;s
visit was over.</p>

<p>While the dean was talking to Mr. Harmer
about the work the boys had done during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
past few months, the boys themselves were quietly
talking about their chances.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I had been unwell to-day,&#8221; said Harry
Cox, &#8220;so that I should not have been able to
come. Frank Pitt, lucky beggar, is at home with
a bad cold. I wish I had twenty colds!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find it warm enough presently to cure
all your colds, Harry,&#8221; said Steve. &#8220;I hope the
dean is in a good temper; he is sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t likely to be so with me, anyhow,&#8221;
observed King, who was trying to put on a bold
face and tone; but it was rather a failure, for he
looked more nervous than anyone.</p>

<p>The dean took the master&#8217;s seat and glanced
round the class. Not a sound was heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been reading the report on your conduct,
boys, and on the whole it is satisfactory,
although I find some complaints. It appears
that at times some of you boys have not been
quite so truthful as I should like to see. All
British boys like to be thought brave! Quite
right, too. I like to see brave boys, and so always
remember this, that lying is the refuge of cowards.
Don&#8217;t forget what I say, boys. To be brave you
must be truthful. I am not going to preach to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dean looked at Harry Cox and two other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
boys. They all felt and looked very much
ashamed.</p>

<p>Mr. Harmer and Mr. Young left the room,
and the dean took his seat at the masters desk.</p>

<p>He was glancing over the list of subjects
which the boys had done, when suddenly a voice
exclaimed, &#8220;Come, Joe, hurry up!&#8221; Then there
was a quiet laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;What boy has dared to make that impertinent
remark?&#8221; exclaimed the dean angrily.</p>

<p>No boy answered or moved.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will severely punish every boy, if necessary,
to find out the guilty one,&#8221; said the dean.</p>

<p>Still no boy answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you are all silent, I shall question each
one of you separately, and the boy who has been
guilty of this insult shall be severely punished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Herbert King,&#8221; said the dean, &#8220;stand up.
Did you speak, or do you know who spoke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; replied King, pale with fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phew!&#8221; came the sound of a whistle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who whistled?&#8221; exclaimed the dean. &#8220;It
was one of you boys at the end of the room. Do
you suppose I cannot tell where the sound comes
from? Stand up, every one of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>As the boys rose a voice called out, &#8220;Wipe your
boots!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>The dean looked at the boys in blank astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of you boys is trying to mock me by
imitating a man&#8217;s voice. How dare you? Which
boy is it? It must be one of you who were
sitting on that end form. Unless you at once
confess, I will send for Mr. Harmer and have
you all caned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; said the voice.</p>

<p>The dean could see that none of the boys was
speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want a pill?&#8221; said the voice.</p>

<p>The dean and all the boys looked towards the
end of the room. No one was there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the bottle?&#8221; said the voice, and then
there was a loud whistle, followed by a sneeze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir,&#8221; said Steve, &#8220;there&#8217;s Mr. Cottenham&#8217;s
parrot on that beam. He lost it last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear! Oh dear!&#8221; said Polly, &#8220;where&#8217;s the
sugar?&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve was right. There was the lost parrot
eyeing the boys in a very knowing manner.
Had the dean been anyone else than a dean he
must have laughed; as it was, he smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better fetch Mr. Cottenham,&#8221; said
the dean to Steve. &#8220;King, close the window, so
that the bird cannot fly away.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>Away ran Steve as fast as he could, and in
less than five minutes he was at Mr. Cottenham&#8217;s.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_089.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;If you please, sir,&#8221; he exclaimed, breathless,
&#8220;your parrot is in our school-room!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, Steve,&#8221; said Mr. Cottenham, &#8220;is my
Polly up there? I will come back with you at
once and get it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>As they walked to the school, Steve related
the amusing little scene with the dean. He
could enjoy the joke now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry, sir,&#8221; said Mr. Cottenham to
the dean, &#8220;for the had behaviour of my parrot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it, Mr. Cottenham,&#8221; replied the
dean, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out! Shop, you&#8217;re wanted!&#8221; said Poll,
who flew on to its master&#8217;s shoulder, and
rubbed its head against him. &#8220;Good-bye!&#8221;
shrieked the bird, as Mr. Cottenham left the
room with it.</p>

<p>Quiet and attention having been restored, the
dean proceeded to test the class, each boy in
turn having to stand up and answer a number of
questions on various subjects. If a boy appeared
nervous, he was told to sit down again, and
was examined later on. Alfred did very well,
and so did his friends; not so Cox, who was
severely reproved for his idleness and ignorance.
King did well, for he was in some subjects at the
head of the school.</p>

<p>When Mr. Harmer returned, the dean said
that he was much pleased with the boys on the
whole, but a few had done badly, and he named
Cox in particular.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>&#8220;As you have done so well, boys,&#8221; said the
dean, &#8220;except those three I have named, I shall
ask Mr. Harmer to excuse you any more work
to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; said most of the boys.</p>

<p>The dean left the school-room, and Mr. Harmer
took his usual place.</p>

<p>&#8220;As the dean has given you a holiday,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;I shall let you all go at once, except those
he has named.&#8221;</p>

<p>Away the boys ran, leaving their unfortunate,
or perhaps it should be said their idle, school-fellows
to receive extra work for the rest of the
term.</p>

<p>Walter, Steve, and Alfred called on their way
home to see that Mr. Cottenham&#8217;s parrot was all
right, and found it as talkative as ever, being
none the worse for the dean&#8217;s reproofs, or for its
flight from the cat.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>THE OLD PIT.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ALFRED&#8217;S father had returned home, and
had written to him saying that they were
all coming to see him on the following day. It
was not many miles from Darlton to the old city
where Alfred was. He had done all his work
well, and both Mr. Harmer and Dr. Phillips had
praised him for his industry and attention.</p>

<p>Mr. Cottenham, unknown to the boys, had told
Mr. Harmer that Cox had bought an arithmetic
book and key with the answers, and the master
had promised to look carefully over his sums in
future. Cox thought himself very cunning, and
used to do about one sum in three wrong, so
that his master might not suspect him. But
boys forget that, however clever they may think
themselves, masters have eyes, and also have
been boys themselves, and know what tricks
are done in school.</p>

<p>For several mornings Mr. Harmer did not look
carefully over Cox&#8217;s sums, but merely asked him
to read out the answers. A day came, however,
on which the boys were given a holiday after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
services in the cathedral, and Mr. Harmer felt
certain that Cox would have all his sums quite
correct, in order that he might not be kept in.
As usual, he was simply asked to read out the
answers. Cox did so; they were all correct, as
Mr. Harmer had expected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring your book here,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Cox brought up his arithmetic book.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Cox,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I wish to see your exercise
book, with the working of the sums.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t put quite all the working down,
sir,&#8221; stammered Cox, turning very red. &#8220;I did
the sums first on a piece of paper at home, and
then threw it away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring up your book.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cox brought it. The sums were commenced
all right, and the answer was correct also, but
there were several mistakes in the working
which could not possibly have produced the
results put down.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very extraordinary, Cox, how you could
get such an answer from that working.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, I copied the sums in the book in
a hurry, perhaps I made some mistakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps! Come now, tell me the truth.
Have you a book with answers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have never bought such a book?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>&#8220;No, sir, never.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not go into Mr. Thrupp&#8217;s a fortnight
ago and buy one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; replied Cox hesitatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you stand there, Cox, and tell me
such a deliberate falsehood? If you do not at
once speak the truth, I will take you to the dean.
I have seen Mr. Thrupp, who knows you, and he
said you did buy a copy. Mr. Thrupp also told
me that you bought a similar book last term. I
have not the slightest doubt now that you put
that leaf of answers into Davidson&#8217;s book, or, at
least, that it belonged to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cox did not reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Cox, listen to me. Either you will
answer my questions truthfully, or I will take
you this very minute to the dean. Did you put
that page in Davidson&#8217;s book?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know who did put it there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cox was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to answer me, or do you prefer
to go to the dean?&#8221;</p>

<p>This decided Cox.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>&#8220;It was Herbert King, sir, who put it in the
book.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;King, I am ashamed of you! A boy of your
age to do such a paltry trick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, I only did it for a joke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A joke! A joke is only a joke when both
sides can laugh. It was a mean, despicable trick
to do, and Davidson might have been unjustly
punished for it. You are leaving at the end of
this term, King, or I should feel very much
inclined to send you to the dean. I shall cane
you both now before the whole school as a warning
to others, and a just punishment to yourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Harmer was as good as his word, and the
two boys returned to their places not only in
pain, but in humiliation. King felt the disgrace
even more keenly than his companion, for he
was the biggest boy in the school.</p>

<p>All the class had of course stopped work and
looked on, many of them in fear, as Mr. Harmer
was very rarely as angry as they saw him that
morning. When the lessons and services were
over, Cox and King slunk away by themselves.</p>

<p>Alfred had arranged to meet his two friends
about half a mile beyond the old pit. He did
not accompany them, as he was going to write a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
letter to his father, and it took Alfred much
longer to write such a letter than Walter and
Steve would care to wait. He had arranged,
therefore, to join them at the place at which
they usually fished. The two boys had gone in
a boat, but Alfred was to take a short cut across
the fields in order that he might not lose too
much time.</p>

<p>The letter was written and posted, and away
Alfred ran to find his chums. He was as happy
as a boy could be at the prospect of meeting all
his family again, and he was also very glad that
his innocence was proved. When he was passing
near the old pit which Mr. Harmer had forbidden
the boys to visit, he saw King and Cox playing
together, or rather trying to amuse themselves.
King threw his cap at Cox, and, missing him,
it fell down the pit.</p>

<p>&#8220;That serves you right,&#8221; exclaimed Cox, laughing
at King. &#8220;Now you&#8217;ve lost your cap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t. I shall climb down and get
it. It isn&#8217;t deep. I have been down several
times before.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pit was not apparently very deep, owing
to the sides having fallen in after some very
heavy rains. There was a rude fence round the
mouth of it, formed by lashing scaffold poles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
together. These the boys used to untie, knot
the pieces of cord together, and let each other
down. One pit in the vicinity had lately been
flooded, and in the bottom of this old one there
was some water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Herbert,&#8221; said Cox, &#8220;your cap won&#8217;t be much
improved by that muddy water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can wash it in the river afterwards,&#8221;
replied King. &#8220;Come and lend me a hand, and
we will soon get these pieces of rope off and tied
together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder how much water there is at the
bottom!&#8221; said Cox, looking down at the dark
muddy water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a few inches. I know the depth of the
pit when it is dry, and I can see there isn&#8217;t
much difference in it. You had better go down,
but I will if you are afraid. I don&#8217;t think you
are strong enough to help me up again, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Cox, looking very
doubtfully at the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be in such a funk,&#8221; exclaimed King,
&#8220;or I shall tie the rope round one of these posts
and let myself down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not in a funk,&#8221; said Cox. &#8220;I will go
down when we get these pieces tied together.
This rope is a bit rotten, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s all right. It has borne my weight,
and so I am sure it will yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cox did not seem at all in a hurry to commence
the descent, which was perhaps some thirty or
forty feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes young sneak,&#8221; he exclaimed, as
he saw Alfred running across the other side of
the field. &#8220;Stop him.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as Alfred heard this, he ran as fast as
he could, but King soon overtook him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Herbert,&#8221; called out Cox, &#8220;let&#8217;s make him go
down and fetch your cap. He&#8217;s fond of sneaking,
so that will give him something to talk
about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Harry,&#8221; replied King, &#8220;a jolly fine
idea that! Now, little sneak, you are going
down that pit to fetch up my cap, do you hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Alfred, &#8220;I hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say you don&#8217;t intend to go
down there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; replied Alfred firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Supposing I say I will make you, what
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alfred did not reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you won&#8217;t go after his cap, perhaps you
will after your own,&#8221; exclaimed Cox, taking
Alfred&#8217;s cap and throwing it down the pit.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>King laughed. Alfred remained still, without
attempting to move. King shook him roughly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, look here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You are going
down to fetch those caps quietly, or we shall tie
this rope round you and drop you down, whether
you like it or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t go,&#8221; replied Alfred, &#8220;and
if you don&#8217;t leave me alone, I&#8217;ll kick you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then clear off, little sneak,&#8221; exclaimed King
angrily, and shaking him violently. &#8220;Come,
Harry, and get my cap, and leave his there until
called for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cox would have liked to refuse, as Alfred had
done, only he feared the jeers of his chum. So
he allowed himself to be bound with the cord,
while the other end was secured to a post. King
intended to lower him gradually. Alfred remained
where he was, simply looking on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Harry,&#8221; said King, &#8220;you must steady yourself
against the side as you go down, and when
you climb up again, dig your feet well into the
loose earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this tied tightly?&#8221; asked Cox, who was
very nervous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s all right. Come, are you ready?&#8221;
cried King.</p>

<p>Cox approached the mouth, and Alfred then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
came nearer and watched them. They seemed
to have forgotten his presence for the time.
Slowly Cox began to descend; King, being a
strong boy, let the rope slide gradually. Alfred
went to the very edge of the pit and saw Cox
going slowly lower and lower.</p>

<p>Suddenly King&#8217;s feet slipped and he loosened
his hold of the rope. Cox fell some feet with a
jerk, when the cord snapped, and a loud splash
was heard.</p>

<p>Pale with fear, both King and Alfred gazed
down and saw that Cox had disappeared beneath
the water. In a few seconds&mdash;which
seemed hours&mdash;his head appeared above the
surface.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help! help!&#8221; he screamed, and again disappeared.</p>

<p>King stood still, paralysed with fear.</p>

<p>In a moment Alfred had grasped the rope and
descended rapidly, blistering his hands as he did
so.</p>

<p>He had reached the water. Cox had risen
again almost senseless. He grasped him by his
jacket and held him with one hand, while he
clutched the rope with the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;King,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I can&#8217;t hold him long.
Get some help at once! My arm is breaking!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>King was aroused by his cry, and looked
wildly around. The rope was too rotten for him
to dare to descend. There was no one to help
them. Suddenly he seized one of the poles
which formed the fence.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_101.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p>&#8220;Davidson, I will drop down one of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
poles! Look out! Hang on to it when it is in
the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pole reached the water with a splash, and
as it did so, the upper end struck Alfred&#8217;s head a
violent blow which almost stunned him. Away
rushed King for help.</p>

<p>Alfred could feel the blood trickling down his
face from the wound he had received. He felt
faint and giddy, and his arms seemed to have
lost all sense of feeling. He tried to cry out, but
his tongue seemed to cleave to his mouth. He
knew he could not hold on much longer, and if
he let his school-fellow go, he must be drowned.
All this flashed through his mind in an instant.
His feet touched something. It was the pole,
which was floating almost upright. He rested
one foot on it, and it gradually sank, but after it
had sunk about a foot he felt it was firmer, and
he thought it must be resting on the bottom of
the pit.</p>

<p>The poles were each some twenty feet long,
and his heart sank when he realized that there
was that depth of water. He was able now, by
putting both feet on the end of the pole, to rest
himself a little, but he was obliged also to keep
Cox&#8217;s head up above the water. He wondered
if Cox were dead. His face was white and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
his eyes were closed. Would no one ever
come?</p>

<p>He dared not loosen his hold either of the
rope or of his school-fellow. He felt faint! He
could not see distinctly! Everything was fading
away!</p>

<p>Suddenly the pole slipped a few inches. This
roused him again. He determined that he would
not let his burden go, come what might.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on, Davidson,&#8221; cried out King. &#8220;Mr.
Cottenham is here with a stout rope.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alfred clung desperately to the rope and to
Harry Cox, who was still unconscious, the dead
weight of his burden nearly dragging his arms
but of their sockets. At last, looking up, he saw
a dark figure descending. Could he hold on a
few seconds more? Again everything became
dim; he thought he heard a noise, and then he
became unconscious.</p>

<p>Mr. Cottenham had brought two long pieces
of rope, which he had fastened to two posts; by
one he descended, and the second he had ready
to put round one of the boys. Walter Parker
and Steve Gray had come with him, and together
with King they awaited the signal to haul up.
Just as he reached Alfred, the boy&#8217;s eyes seemed
fixed, and then they closed, and with a sigh he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
fell into the chemist&#8217;s stout arms. He grasped
both of the boys with his free arm, and then,
getting a footing on the sunken pole, he managed
to fasten the cord round Alfred, and shouted to
the boys above to pull away.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he saw Alfred landed safely,
and again they lowered the rope. With less
difficulty he secured it round Harry Cox, and as
soon as he saw him fairly up, he climbed up himself.</p>

<p>Harry Cox&#8217;s eyes were open, and he stared
wildly round. Mr. Cottenham, after bandaging
Alfred&#8217;s head, seized Cox in his arms, while
Walter took Alfred, and they walked as rapidly
as possible towards the cottage hospital, which
was not very far distant.</p>

<p>In a few minutes both boys were put to bed
and attended by the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;A narrow escape this,&#8221; he said to Mr. Cottenham,
who was assisting him in restoring animation
to the boys.</p>

<p>Cox soon recovered, and gazed about vacantly,
and then asked where he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not talk now,&#8221; said the doctor;
&#8220;lie still.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was some time before Alfred recovered.
When he opened his eyes he saw the kind face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of Mr. Cottenham at his side. He felt a burning
heat in his throbbing temples, and when he tried
to speak he could not utter a word.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_105.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The doctor gave him some medicine, and he
soon fell asleep, with dreams of falling over
precipices and down pits.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>King, with Walter and Steve, waited about for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
two hours before Mr. Cottenham returned to tell
them that Alfred was better.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better go and tell Mr. Harmer what
has happened,&#8221; he said to Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think, sir, that they will die?&#8221; inquired
King, with an anxious look on his now
pale face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; replied Mr. Cottenham. &#8220;They
are progressing as well as can be expected. If
you call on me as you go to school to-morrow
morning, I will let you know how they are. Do
you know Alfred Davidson&#8217;s home address,
Steve?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; he replied, giving it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will write to his mother at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Alfred dangerously ill?&#8221; asked Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;The doctor hopes for the best, but there is
cause for anxiety. He will come to my place
for his weekly chat and smoke, and so I shall
hear the latest tidings to-night, and early to-morrow
I shall come up here and see how the
boys are. I think Cox will soon be well again,
but with Alfred it will be a longer affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Very early the next morning King was waiting
at Mr. Cottenham&#8217;s to hear how they were.
He had hardly slept a wink all night. He
knew that he had been the cause of the accident;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and if Alfred should die&mdash;! He shuddered at
the thought.</p>

<p>Both Walter and Steve were out early, and
found King still waiting outside Mr. Cottenham&#8217;s.
At last the chemist appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is Davidson, sir?&#8221; inquired King
earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cox is much better, and in a couple of days
will probably be quite well,&#8221; replied Mr. Cottenham.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is Alfred, sir?&#8221; asked Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just telegraphed for his mother to
come at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he worse, sir?&#8221; inquired Walter. King
was too anxious to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid he is,&#8221; replied Mr. Cottenham
shortly. &#8220;Come again after dinner and I will
let you know any further news of him.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As Mr. Cottenham had said, Cox was sufficiently
well in two days to be removed to his own home.
The strain on Alfred&#8217;s system, added to the blow
on his head, caused a dangerous illness; but,
thanks to his youth and naturally good constitution,
assisted by the close attention of a
kind nurse and skilful doctor, he did recover.
His mother had come, and soon afterwards his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
father also arrived, and when Alfred was out of
danger, his joy may readily be imagined at
seeing both of his parents at his bedside. Later
in the day his sister came, and his good friend
Mr. Cottenham.</p>

<p>As he got better, the doctor said that he
might, in a few days, be removed to his home for
a change.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alfie,&#8221; said his mother, &#8220;we have a lot of
good news for you. Your father has been
appointed to a good position at Eastport, so
that he will not be obliged to go any more
voyages; and the directors have given him a
hundred pounds for his services in that great
storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, I am so happy now!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;I should like to see Mr. Cottenham again. I
have never thanked him for saving my life. If
he had not come, I am sure I could not have held
on any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Alfred returned to the school after his
holiday at home, he was told to come at five
o&#8217;clock, after the service, to the cathedral library.
No one had said a word to him of what was
intended, and great was his surprise when he
saw the large room crowded with people.
Walter and Steve took charge of him. All the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
choir were there, and the clergy as well. Mr.
Cottenham occupied a place on the platform,
and the dean delivered a short address on the
gallant rescue of a school-fellow by Alfred Davidson.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_109.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Alfred,&#8221; said Walter, &#8220;you have to go up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
receive a medal. The dean has called out your
name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scarcely knowing what he was doing, Alfred
went up to the platform, and amid the loud
cheers of his fellow-choristers and the applause
of others, the dean&#8217;s daughter presented him
with a medal.</p>

<p>When the dean afterwards made reference to
the timely assistance of Mr. Cottenham, the
applause was scarcely less than that which
Alfred had received. After the presentation was
over, all the choir-boys were invited by Mr.
Cottenham to tea in his garden. And it was a
tea! One of the boys asked him if he had been
to India to fetch the delicacies. There is one
little incident more to be recorded. While all
the boys were seated at the table, King and Cox
got out of their seats and came to Alfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Davidson,&#8221; said King, in a voice choked with
emotion, &#8220;Harry Cox and I want to give you
this. I can&#8217;t make a speech like the dean, but I
hope you won&#8217;t refuse it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a silver watch, engraved on the inside
with Alfred&#8217;s name, the date, and these words,
&#8220;For a gallant rescue at the risk of his own
life&#8221;.</p>

<p>It may be doubted whether their united means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
would have secured so expensive a present if
Mr. Cottenham had not heard of their intention.
The choir-boys subscribed for the chain, and the
organist, Dr. Phillips, gave Alfred a very handsome
book.</p>

<p>This gallant rescue is still treasured among the
annals of the choir-school of St. Bede&#8217;s.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
